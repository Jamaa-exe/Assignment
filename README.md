# CloudUpload Mock App (Flask)

This is a simple Flask web app that mimics uploading files to the cloud. It allows users to select a file and displays a fake upload success messageâ€”no actual file is stored on the server.

## Features
- Upload form for selecting files
- Simulated upload success (no file storage)
- Clean, minimal Flask backend

## Purpose
Built for learning and demo purposes. Ideal for practicing Flask routes and form handling without connecting to real cloud storage.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Flask
- HTML/CSS (for frontend)

## How to Run
```bash
pip install flask
python app.py
